Data visualisation is a key statistical tool for effective communication and to understand aspects of data and models. The statistical language R is used widely for data analysis and visualization, e.g. the BBC Visual and Data Journalism team uses ggplot2 R-package to create production-ready charts. This workshop will teach you how to create production-ready graphics using the grammar of graphics implemented in ggplot2 R-package. The workshop will be hands-on with plenty of practical examples.

## Learning objectives

- Review of tidy data format
- Basics of the grammar of graphics
- Drawing the basic data plot types (barchart, pie chart, histogram, density plot, scatterplot, boxplot) utilising a range of common geoms and variable mappings
- Choosing colour wisely
- All about scales, transforming data, setting limits, changing coordinate systems, axis specifications, ordering levels of categorical axes
- Jazzing up your plot with different themes, plot annotations and combining plots together to make a publication-ready plot

## Requirements

- basic R knowledge (e.g. you have used R to load data, create simple visualisations, perform basic analyses and write simple functions or more specifically, you are familiar with concepts in Cookbook for R by Winston Chang)
- laptop (with ability to install R and R-packages)

### Desirable

- Know about tidy data (i.e. importing data and putting data into the right format for plotting)
- Some familiarity with tidyverse
